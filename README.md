This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: the RecursionError. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a factorial function that does not handle negative input correctly. This leads to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The `factorial_solution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles negative input and avoids the error.
